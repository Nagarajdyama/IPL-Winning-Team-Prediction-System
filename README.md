# 🏏 IPL Winning Team Prediction System

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project leverages **machine learning models** to predict the winning team in an **IPL match** based on historical data, team performance, player statistics, venue conditions, and other influencing factors. Using **advanced ensemble models**, interactive UI elements, and **stylish animations**, it provides an engaging and data-driven match prediction experience.

## 🎯 Features
✅ **Machine Learning-Based Predictions** – Uses **Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost**, and **Neural Networks** to predict outcomes.  
✅ **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** – Aggregates team-level **batting & bowling statistics** from historical IPL matches and deliveries data.  
✅ **Interactive UI** – A **Streamlit-powered interface** where users can select teams, toss winners, and visualize predictions.  
✅ **Dynamic Winner Animation** – A **balloon animation** followed by a **smooth text-size reduction effect** for displaying the predicted winner.  
✅ **Optimized Model Training** – Utilizes **hyperparameter tuning (Optuna)** to enhance prediction accuracy.
